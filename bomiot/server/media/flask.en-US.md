# Flask

### Create a Project:

```shell
bomiot project <project_name>
```

###  Project Structure

```
my-project/                    # Project directory
├── flask_app/                 # flask app
│   └── main.py                # Main file
...
```

- Then you can write your Flask application within this main.py.
